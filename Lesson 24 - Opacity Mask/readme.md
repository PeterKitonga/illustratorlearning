## About Lesson 24

### Brief
In this lesson, I learned how to make an opacity mask using the ```Transparency``` palette. I used it to create a reflection in combination with a gradient. _Note: with masks, one will notice that black always hides and white shows._

### Illustrations

In this example I created a duplicate of the iphone bitmap and flipped it vertically using the drop down options in the ```Transform``` palette. I then aligned the duplicate image at the bottom of the original and reduced the opacity. I added an Opacity Mask by selecting it from the dropdown menu options of the ```Transparency``` palette. This is where I selected the mask and added a rectangle shape object with white fill color. This immediately started showing the masked iphone. I added a gradient and changed the angle. This created a reflection effect.
