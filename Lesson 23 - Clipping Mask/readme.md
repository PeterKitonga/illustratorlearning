## About Lesson 23

### Brief
In this lesson, I learned how to make clipping masks using the menu ```Object > Clipping Mask > Make```. Clipping masks allow us to control the visibility of a layer.

### Illustrations

In this example I first created an circle using the ```Elipse Tool```. I then selected the image and the shape object and created a clipping mask through the menu ```Object > Clipping Mask > Make```.

Here, I applied a clipping mask to text and applied a drop shadow effect to make it visible.
